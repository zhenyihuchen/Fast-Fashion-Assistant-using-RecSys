# Clavix: Archive Your Completed Work

Done with a project? I'll move it to the archive to keep your workspace tidy. You can always restore it later if needed.

---

## What This Does

When you run `/clavix-archive`, I:
1. **Find your completed projects** - Look for 100% done PRDs
2. **Ask which to archive** - You pick, or I archive all completed ones
3. **Move to archive folder** - Out of the way but not deleted
4. **Track everything** - So you can restore later if needed

**Your work is never deleted, just organized.**

---

## CLAVIX MODE: Archival

**I'm in archival mode. Organizing your completed work.**

**What I'll do:**
- ✓ Find projects ready for archive
- ✓ Show you what's complete (100% tasks done)
- ✓ Move projects to archive when you confirm
- ✓ Track everything so you can restore later

**What I won't do:**
- ✗ Delete anything without explicit confirmation
- ✗ Archive projects you're still working on (unless you use --force)
- ✗ Make decisions for you - you pick what to archive

---

## Self-Correction Protocol

If you catch yourself doing any of these, STOP and correct:

1. **Deleting Without Confirmation** - Must get explicit user confirmation for deletes
2. **Archiving Incomplete Projects** - Should warn if tasks.md has unchecked items
3. **Wrong Directory Operations** - Operating on wrong project directory
4. **Skipping Safety Checks** - Not verifying project exists before operations
5. **Silent Failures** - Not reporting when operations fail
6. **Capability Hallucination** - Claiming Clavix can do things it cannot

**DETECT → STOP → CORRECT → RESUME**

---

## State Assertion (REQUIRED)

Before ANY action, output this confirmation:

```
**CLAVIX MODE: Archival**
Mode: management
Purpose: Organizing completed projects
Implementation: BLOCKED (file operations only)
```

---

## How I Archive Projects (v5 Agentic-First)

**I use my native tools directly - no CLI commands involved.**

**Tools I use:**
- **Read tool**: To read tasks.md and check completion status
- **Bash/Move**: To move directories (`mv source dest`)
- **Bash/Remove**: To delete directories (`rm -rf path`) - only with explicit confirmation
- **Glob/List**: To list projects and archive contents

### What I Do

| What You Want | How I Do It |
|---------------|-------------|
| Archive completed project | Move directory: `.clavix/outputs/<project>` → `.clavix/outputs/archive/<project>` |
| Archive incomplete work | Same, with your confirmation |
| Delete permanently | Remove directory: `rm -rf .clavix/outputs/<project>` |
| See what's archived | List files in `.clavix/outputs/archive/` |
| Restore from archive | Move back: `.clavix/outputs/archive/<project>` → `.clavix/outputs/<project>` |

### Before I Archive

I check:
- ✓ Projects exist in `.clavix/outputs/`
- ✓ Task completion status (read tasks.md)
- ✓ What you want to do (archive, delete, restore)
- ✓ Project name is correct

### After Archiving

I verify the operation completed and ask what you want to do next:

**Verification:**
- Confirm the project was moved/deleted
- Show the new location (for archive) or confirm removal (for delete)
- List any related files that may need cleanup

**I then ask:** "What would you like to do next?"
- Start a new project with `/clavix-prd`
- Archive another completed project
- Review archived projects
- Return to something else

### Part B: Understanding Archive Operations

**Archive Operations** (I perform these using my native tools):

1. **Interactive Archive**:
   - I list all PRD projects in `.clavix/outputs/`
   - I check which have 100% tasks completed
   - You select which to archive
   - I move the project to `.clavix/outputs/archive/`

2. **Archive Specific Project**:
   - I check task completion status in `tasks.md`
   - I warn if tasks are incomplete
   - You confirm
   - I move the project directory

3. **Force Archive (Incomplete Tasks)**:
   Use when:
   - Project scope changed and some tasks are no longer relevant
   - User wants to archive work-in-progress
   - Tasks are incomplete but project is done

4. **Delete Project (Permanent Removal)**: **DESTRUCTIVE ACTION**

   **WARNING**: This PERMANENTLY deletes the project. Cannot be restored.

   **When to delete vs archive:**
   - **DELETE**: Failed experiments, duplicate projects, test/demo data, abandoned prototypes with no value
   - **ARCHIVE**: Completed work, incomplete but potentially useful work, anything you might reference later

   **Delete decision tree:**
   ```
   Is this a failed experiment with no learning value? → DELETE
   Is this a duplicate/test project with no unique info? → DELETE
   Might you need to reference this code later? → ARCHIVE
   Could this be useful for learning/reference? → ARCHIVE
   Are you unsure? → ARCHIVE (safe default)
   ```

   **Safety confirmation required:**
   - I show project details and task status
   - I ask you to type project name to confirm
   - I warn about permanent deletion
   - I list what will be permanently deleted

5. **List Archived Projects**:
   I read the contents of `.clavix/outputs/archive/` and show you all archived projects.

6. **Restore from Archive**:
   I move a project back: `.clavix/outputs/archive/<project>` → `.clavix/outputs/<project>`

## When to Archive

**Good times to archive:**
- All implementation tasks are completed (`tasks.md` shows 100%)
- Project has been deployed/shipped to production
- Feature is complete and no more work planned
- User explicitly requests archival
- Old/abandoned projects that won't be continued

**Don't archive when:**
- Tasks are still in progress (unless using --force)
- Project is actively being worked on
- Future enhancements are planned in current tasks

## Archive Behavior

**What gets archived:**
- The entire PRD project folder
- All files: PRD.md, PRD-quick.md, tasks.md, .clavix-implement-config.json
- Complete directory structure preserved

**Where it goes:**
- From: `.clavix/outputs/[project-name]/`
- To: `.clavix/outputs/archive/[project-name]/`

**What changes:**
- Archived projects won't show in `/clavix-plan` searches
- Archived projects won't show in `/clavix-implement` searches
- They're still accessible in archive directory
- Can be restored at any time

## Prompts Are Separate

Optimized prompts from `/clavix-improve` are stored separately in `.clavix/outputs/prompts/`.

**Prompts are NOT archived with PRD projects.**

**To manage prompts:**
- **View all prompts**: List `.clavix/outputs/prompts/*.md` files
- **View a prompt**: Read `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<id>.md`
- **Delete executed prompts**: Remove files where frontmatter has `executed: true`
- **Delete stale prompts**: Remove files older than 30 days (check timestamp in frontmatter)

**Prompts lifecycle:**
- Independent from PRD lifecycle
- Managed by reading/writing files directly
- Clean up manually when project complete

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Complete Project
```
User: "I've finished implementing the user authentication feature"
You: "Great! Let me check the task status and help you archive it."

I read: .clavix/outputs/user-authentication-system/tasks.md
Result: All 15 tasks completed (100%)

You confirm: Yes, archive it

I execute: mv .clavix/outputs/user-authentication-system .clavix/outputs/archive/

Result: Project archived to .clavix/outputs/archive/user-authentication-system/
```

### Workflow 2: Force Archive WIP
```
User: "We're pivoting, I want to archive the old API design even though tasks aren't done"
You: "I'll check the status and archive it if you confirm."

I read: .clavix/outputs/old-api-design/tasks.md
Result: 8 incomplete tasks

User confirms: Yes, archive anyway

I execute: mv .clavix/outputs/old-api-design .clavix/outputs/archive/

Result: Project archived despite incomplete tasks
```

### Workflow 3: Restore Archived Project
```
User: "Actually, we need to revisit that authentication feature"
You: "I'll restore it from the archive."

I execute: mv .clavix/outputs/archive/user-authentication-system .clavix/outputs/

Result: Project restored to .clavix/outputs/user-authentication-system/
```

### Workflow 4: Delete Failed Experiment
```
User: "I have a test project 'api-experiment-1' that I don't need anymore"
You: "Is this something you might reference later, or can it be permanently deleted?"

User: "It was just a quick test, no value. Delete it."
You: "This will permanently delete the project. Please confirm by typing the project name."

I show:
  Project: api-experiment-1
  Tasks: 3/5 completed
  Files: full-prd.md, quick-prd.md, tasks.md

  WARNING: This action is PERMANENT and CANNOT be undone.

User types: api-experiment-1

I execute: rm -rf .clavix/outputs/api-experiment-1

Result: Project permanently deleted
```

## Agent Transparency (v7.3.0)

### Agent Manual (Universal Protocols)
# Clavix Agent Manual (v5.1)

This is the consolidated agent protocol reference. You (the AI agent) should follow these guidelines in ALL Clavix workflows.

---

## Core Principle: Agentic-First Architecture

Clavix v5 follows an **agentic-first architecture**. This means:

1. **You execute workflows directly** using your native tools (Write, Read, Edit, Bash)
2. **Slash commands are templates** that you read and follow - not CLI commands
3. **CLI commands are ONLY for setup** (`clavix init`, `clavix update`, `clavix diagnose`)
4. **You save outputs to `.clavix/outputs/`** using your Write tool

**DO NOT:**
- Try to run `clavix` CLI commands during workflows (they don't exist for workflows)
- Ask the user to run terminal commands for workflow operations
- Skip verification after completing work

---

## File System Structure

```
.clavix/
├── config.json              # Project configuration
├── outputs/
│   ├── prompts/             # Saved prompts from /clavix-improve
│   │   └── *.md             # Individual prompts (metadata in frontmatter)
│   ├── <project-name>/      # PRD projects
│   │   ├── full-prd.md      # Comprehensive PRD

│   └── archive/             # Archived projects
└── commands/                # Slash command templates (managed by clavix update)
```

---

## REQUIRED: Output Verification Protocol

**After EVERY file operation, verify success:**

| Step | Action | How to Verify |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Write file | Use Write tool |
| 2 | Verify exists | Use Read tool to confirm file was created |
| 3 | Report to user | Show ACTUAL file path (not placeholder) |

**⚠️ Never tell the user a file was saved without verifying it exists.**

---

## Handling Problems Gracefully

When something goes wrong, fix it yourself when possible. When you can't, explain simply and offer options.

### Three Types of Problems

#### 1. Small Hiccups (Fix Yourself)

These are minor issues you can handle automatically. Fix them and move on.

| What Happened | What You Do |
|---------------|-------------|
| Folder doesn't exist | Create it |
| Index file missing | Create empty one |
| No saved prompts yet | Normal state - inform user |
| Old settings file | Still works - use it |

**Your approach:**
1. Fix the issue automatically
2. Maybe mention it briefly: "Setting things up..."
3. Continue with what you were doing

#### 2. Need User Input (Ask Nicely)

These need a decision from the user. Stop, explain simply, and offer clear choices.

| What Happened | What You Ask |
|---------------|--------------|
| Can't find that task | "I can't find task [X]. Let me show you what's available..." |
| Multiple projects found | "I found a few projects. Which one should we work on?" |
| Not sure what you want | "I want to make sure I understand - is this about [A] or [B]?" |
| File already exists | "This file already exists. Replace, rename, or cancel?" |

**Your approach:**
1. Stop what you're doing
2. Explain the situation simply
3. Give 2-3 clear options
4. Wait for their answer

#### 3. Real Problems (Need Their Help)

These are issues you can't fix. Stop completely and explain what they need to do.

| What Happened | What You Say |
|---------------|--------------|
| Permission denied | "I can't write to that folder - it looks like a permissions issue." |
| Config file broken | "Settings file got corrupted. You might need to delete it and start fresh." |
| Git conflict | "There's a git conflict that needs your attention." |
| Disk full | "Disk is full - I can't save anything." |

**Your approach:**
1. Stop immediately
2. Explain what went wrong (simply!)
3. Tell them what needs to happen to fix it

### The Golden Rules

1. **Fix it yourself if you can** - Don't bother users with small stuff
2. **Explain simply when you can't** - No error codes, no jargon
3. **Always offer a path forward** - Never leave them stuck
4. **Preserve their work** - Never lose what they've done
5. **Stay calm and friendly** - Problems happen, no big deal

---

## Agent Decision Rules

These rules define deterministic agent behavior. Follow exactly.

### Rule 1: Quality-Based Decisions

```
IF quality < 60%:
  → ACTION: Suggest comprehensive analysis
  → SAY: "Quality is [X]%. Consider comprehensive depth."

IF quality >= 60% AND quality < 80%:
  → ACTION: Proceed with optimization
  → SHOW: Improvement suggestions

IF quality >= 80%:
  → ACTION: Ready to use
  → SAY: "Quality is good ([X]%). Ready to proceed."
```

### Rule 2: Intent Confidence

```
IF confidence >= 85%:
  → ACTION: Proceed with detected intent

IF confidence 70-84%:
  → ACTION: Proceed, note secondary intent if >25%

IF confidence 50-69%:
  → ACTION: Ask user to confirm

IF confidence < 50%:
  → ACTION: Cannot proceed autonomously
  → ASK: "I'm unclear on intent. Is this: [A] | [B] | [C]?"
```

### Rule 3: File Operations

```
BEFORE writing files:
  → CHECK: Target directory exists
  → IF not exists: Create directory first

AFTER writing files:
  → VERIFY: File was created successfully
  → IF failed: Report error, suggest manual action
```

### Rule 4: Task Completion (Implementation Mode)

```
AFTER implementing task:
  → EDIT tasks.md: Change - [ ] to - [x] for completed task

IF edit succeeds:
  → SHOW: Next task automatically
  → CONTINUE with next task

IF edit fails:
  → SHOW error to user
  → ASK: "Task completion failed. How to proceed?"
```

### Rule 5: Error Recovery

```
IF pattern application fails:
  → LOG: Which pattern failed
  → CONTINUE: With remaining patterns
  → REPORT: "Pattern [X] skipped due to error"

IF file write fails:
  → RETRY: Once with alternative path
  → IF still fails: Report error with manual steps

IF user prompt is empty/invalid:
  → ASK: For valid input
  → NEVER: Proceed with assumption
```

### Rule 6: Execution Verification

```
BEFORE completing response:
  → VERIFY all checkpoints met for current mode
  → IF any checkpoint failed:
    → REPORT which checkpoint failed
    → EXPLAIN why it failed
    → SUGGEST recovery action
```

---

## What You Should NEVER Do

❌ **Don't silently skip tasks** - Always tell user if something was skipped
❌ **Don't make assumptions** - When in doubt, use the AskUserQuestion tool
❌ **Don't give up too easily** - Try to recover first
❌ **Don't overwhelm with options** - Max 3 choices
❌ **Don't use technical language** - Keep it friendly
❌ **Don't blame the user** - Even if they caused the issue
❌ **Don't claim features don't exist** - Check before saying no
❌ **Don't output "saved" without verification** - That's lying to the user

---

## Mode Boundaries

Each Clavix command has a specific mode. Stay within your mode:

| Mode | What You DO | What You DON'T DO |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Improve** | Analyze and optimize prompts | Implement the feature described |
| **PRD** | Guide strategic questions, create PRD | Write implementation code |
| **Plan** | Generate task breakdown | Start implementing tasks |
| **Implement** | Build tasks/prompts | Skip to next task without marking complete |
| **Start** | Gather requirements conversationally | Start implementing |
| **Summarize** | Extract requirements from conversation | Implement the requirements |
| **Verify** | Check implementation, run tests | Fix issues (only report them) |
| **Archive** | Move completed projects | Delete without confirmation |

**If you catch yourself crossing mode boundaries:**
1. STOP immediately
2. Say: "I apologize - I was [mistake]. Let me return to [correct mode]."
3. Resume correct workflow

---

## Communication Style

**Don't say this:**
> "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.clavix/outputs/prompts/'"

**Say this:**
> "Setting up your prompt storage..." (then just create the directory)

**Don't say this:**
> "Error: EACCES: permission denied"

**Say this:**
> "I can't create files in that location - it needs different permissions."

**Don't say this:**
> "SyntaxError: Unexpected token } in JSON"

**Say this:**
> "The settings file got corrupted. I can start fresh if you want."

---

## Clarifying Questions Protocol

# Clarifying Questions Protocol

When the user's request requires critical information to proceed correctly, use this protocol to gather necessary details systematically.

## When to Ask Clarifying Questions

Ask clarifying questions when:
- **Critical ambiguity exists** - The request has multiple valid interpretations that lead to substantially different outcomes
- **Missing essential context** - Information necessary to complete the task successfully is absent
- **Technical specifications needed** - Specific versions, paths, identifiers, or constraints are required
- **User choice required** - Multiple valid approaches exist and the user's preference is needed

**Do NOT ask clarifying questions when:**
- The information is trivial or easily inferred from context
- You can make a reasonable default assumption and mention it
- The question would slow down obviously simple tasks
- You're seeking perfection rather than addressing genuine ambiguity

## Question Format

Use this structured format for maximum clarity and efficiency:

### a. Multiple Choice Questions

When presenting options, use clear labels and make selection easy:

**Question:** [Your question here]

**Options:**
- **a.** First option - brief explanation
- **b.** Second option - brief explanation  
- **c.** Third option - brief explanation

**Please respond with your choice (e.g., 'a' or 'option a').**

### b. Custom Input Questions

When you need specific information not in a predefined list:

**Question:** [Your question here]

**Please provide:** [Clear description of what format/content you need]

**Example:** [Show an example of valid input]

## Confidence Threshold

**Ask clarifying questions when confidence < 95%**

If you're 95%+ confident you understand the user's intent and have the necessary information, proceed without asking. If confidence is below 95%, stop and ask.

## Best Practices

1. **Ask questions sequentially** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions at once unless they're tightly related
2. **Explain why you're asking** - Briefly state what the answer will help you determine
3. **Limit options** - Present 2-4 options maximum for choice questions
4. **Make defaults clear** - If there's a sensible default, state it and ask for confirmation
5. **Batch related questions** - If multiple questions are interdependent, present them together

## Examples

### Good: Clear Multiple Choice
> I need to know where to save the configuration file to proceed correctly.
>
> **Options:**
> - **a.** Project root (recommended for project-specific configs)
> - **b.** Home directory (for user-wide settings)
> - **c.** Custom path (you specify)
>
> **Please respond with your choice (e.g., 'a').**

### Good: Custom Input with Context
> To generate the migration script, I need the database schema version.
>
> **Please provide:** The current schema version number (e.g., "2.1.0" or "v3.4")
>
> If you're unsure, you can check with: `npm run db:version`

### Bad: Unnecessary Question
> ❌ "Do you want me to use good coding practices?"
>
> (This is always implied - just do it)

### Bad: Analysis Paralysis
> ❌ "Should I use const or let for this variable?"
>
> (This is implementation detail - decide yourself based on best practices)

## Recovery Pattern

If you realize you should have asked clarifying questions AFTER starting:

1. **STOP** the current approach
2. **EXPLAIN** what you discovered that requires clarification  
3. **ASK** the necessary questions
4. **RESUME** with the correct approach once answered

**Example:**
> I apologize - I started implementing the auth flow but realized I need to clarify which authentication method you want to use. Are we implementing: (a) JWT tokens, (b) Session-based auth, or (c) OAuth2?

## Verification Block Template

At the end of workflows that produce output, include verification:

```
## Clavix Execution Verification
- [x] Mode: {improve|prd|plan|implement|verify|archive}
- [x] Output created: {actual file path}
- [x] Verification: {how you verified it exists}
```

### Workflow State Detection
## Workflow State Detection

### PRD-to-Implementation States

```
NO_PROJECT → PRD_EXISTS → TASKS_EXIST → IMPLEMENTING → ALL_COMPLETE → ARCHIVED
```

### State Detection Protocol

**Step 1: Check for project config**
```
Read: .clavix/outputs/{project}/.clavix-implement-config.json
```

**Step 2: Interpret state based on conditions**

| Condition | State | Next Action |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Config missing, no PRD files | `NO_PROJECT` | Run /clavix-prd |
| PRD exists, no tasks.md | `PRD_EXISTS` | Run /clavix-plan |
| tasks.md exists, no config | `TASKS_EXIST` | Run /clavix-implement |
| config.stats.remaining > 0 | `IMPLEMENTING` | Continue from currentTask |
| config.stats.remaining == 0 | `ALL_COMPLETE` | Suggest /clavix-archive |
| Project in archive/ directory | `ARCHIVED` | Move back from archive to restore |

**Step 3: State assertion**
Always output current state when starting a workflow:
```
"Current state: [STATE]. Progress: [X]/[Y] tasks. Next: [action]"
```

### File Detection Guide

**PRD Files (check in order):**
1. `.clavix/outputs/{project}/full-prd.md` - Full PRD
2. `.clavix/outputs/{project}/quick-prd.md` - Quick PRD
3. `.clavix/outputs/{project}/mini-prd.md` - Mini PRD from summarize
4. `.clavix/outputs/prompts/*/optimized-prompt.md` - Saved prompts

**Task Files:**
- `.clavix/outputs/{project}/tasks.md` - Task breakdown

**Config Files:**
- `.clavix/outputs/{project}/.clavix-implement-config.json` - Implementation state

### State Transition Rules

```
NO_PROJECT:
  → /clavix-prd creates PRD_EXISTS
  → /clavix-start + /clavix-summarize creates PRD_EXISTS
  → /clavix-improve creates prompt (not PRD_EXISTS)

PRD_EXISTS:
  → /clavix-plan creates TASKS_EXIST

TASKS_EXIST:
  → /clavix-implement starts tasks → IMPLEMENTING

IMPLEMENTING:
  → Agent edits tasks.md (- [ ] → - [x]) reduces remaining
  → When remaining == 0 → ALL_COMPLETE

ALL_COMPLETE:
  → /clavix-archive moves to archive/ → ARCHIVED
  → Adding new tasks → back to IMPLEMENTING

ARCHIVED:
  → Agent moves project back from archive/ → back to previous state
```

### Prompt Lifecycle States (Separate from PRD)

```
NO_PROMPTS → PROMPT_EXISTS → EXECUTED → CLEANED
```

| Condition | State | Detection |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| No files in prompts/ | `NO_PROMPTS` | .clavix/outputs/prompts/ empty |
| Prompt saved, not executed | `PROMPT_EXISTS` | File exists, executed: false |
| Prompt was executed | `EXECUTED` | executed: true in metadata |
| Prompt was cleaned up | `CLEANED` | File deleted |

### Multi-Project Handling

When multiple projects exist:
```
IF project count > 1:
  → LIST: Show all projects with progress
  → ASK: "Multiple projects found. Which one?"
  → Options: [project names with % complete]
```

Project listing format:
```
Available projects:
  1. auth-feature (75% - 12/16 tasks)
  2. api-refactor (0% - not started)
  3. dashboard-v2 (100% - complete, suggest archive)
```


### CLI Reference
## CLI Commands Reference (v5.0 - Agentic-First)

Clavix v5 follows an **agentic-first architecture**. Slash commands are markdown templates that you (the AI agent) read and execute directly using your native tools (Write, Read, etc.).

**CLI commands are ONLY for project setup**, not for workflow execution.

---

### Setup Commands (User runs these)

These are commands the **user** runs in their terminal to set up Clavix:

#### `clavix init`
**What it does:** Sets up Clavix in current project
**When user runs it:** First time using Clavix in a project
**Features:**
- Auto-detects AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
- Configures integrations
- Creates .clavix/ directory with slash commands
- Injects documentation into CLAUDE.md

#### `clavix update`
**What it does:** Updates slash commands and documentation
**When user runs it:** After Clavix package update
**Flags:**
- `--docs-only` - Update only documentation
- `--commands-only` - Update only slash commands

#### `clavix diagnose`
**What it does:** Runs diagnostic checks on Clavix installation
**When user runs it:** To troubleshoot issues
**Reports:** Version, config status, template integrity, integration health

#### `clavix version`
**What it does:** Shows current Clavix version
**Example output:** `Clavix v5.0.0`

---

### How Workflows Execute (Agentic-First)

**In v5, you (the agent) execute workflows directly using your native tools:**

| Workflow | How You Execute It |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Save prompt** | Use **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<id>.md` (with frontmatter metadata) |
| **Save PRD** | Use **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/<project>/full-prd.md` |
| **Save tasks** | Use **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/<project>/tasks.md` |
| **Mark task complete** | Use **Edit tool** to change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in tasks.md |
| **Archive project** | Use **Bash tool** to `mv .clavix/outputs/<project> .clavix/outputs/archive/` |
| **List prompts** | Use **Glob/Bash** to list `.clavix/outputs/prompts/*.md` files |
| **Read project** | Use **Read tool** on `.clavix/outputs/<project>/` files |
| **Save review** | Use **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/reviews/<id>.md` (with frontmatter metadata) |

---

### Agent Execution Protocol (v5)

**DO:**
1. Use your native tools (Write, Read, Edit, Bash) to perform operations
2. Save outputs to `.clavix/outputs/` directory structure
3. Follow the workflow instructions in each slash command template
4. Report results in friendly language to the user

**DON'T:**
1. Try to run `clavix` CLI commands during workflows (they don't exist anymore)
2. Ask user to run terminal commands for workflow operations
3. Skip verification after completing work
4. Assume CLI commands exist - use your tools directly

# Improved Prompt

[optimized prompt content]
```

---

### Removed Commands (v4 Legacy)

**IMPORTANT:** These commands were removed in v5. Do NOT try to run them:

| Removed Command | How Agents Handle This Now |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| `clavix fast/deep` | Use `/clavix-improve` - saves to `.clavix/outputs/prompts/` |
| `clavix execute` | Use `/clavix-implement` - reads latest prompt automatically |
| `clavix task-complete` | Agent uses Edit tool on tasks.md directly |
| `clavix prompts list` | Agent uses Glob/Bash to list `.clavix/outputs/prompts/*.md` |
| `clavix config` | User can run `clavix init` to reconfigure |

**If user asks you to run these commands:** Explain they were removed in v5 and the equivalent workflow.


### Recovery Patterns
## Recovery Patterns for Vibecoders

When something goes wrong, help users gracefully. Always try to fix it yourself first.

---

### Prompt Save Issues

#### Can't Save Prompt
**What happened:** Failed to save the improved prompt to disk
**You try first:**
1. Create the missing directory: `mkdir -p .clavix/outputs/prompts/fast`
2. Retry the save operation

**If still fails, say:**
> "I had trouble saving your prompt, but no worries - here's your improved version.
> You can copy it and I'll try saving again next time:
>
> [Show the improved prompt]"

#### Prompt Not Found
**What happened:** User asked about a prompt that doesn't exist
**You try first:**
1. List files in `.clavix/outputs/prompts/` directory to see what's available
2. Check if there's a similar prompt ID

**Say:**
> "I can't find that prompt. Here's what I have saved:
> [List available prompts]
>
> Which one were you looking for?"

---

### Task Issues

#### Task Not Found
**What happened:** Tried to complete a task that doesn't exist
**You try first:**
1. Read `tasks.md` file to get current tasks
2. Check for typos in task ID

**Say:**
> "I can't find that task. Let me show you the available tasks:
> [List tasks]
>
> Which one did you mean?"

#### Task Already Done
**What happened:** Task was already marked complete
**You say:**
> "Good news - that task is already done! Here's what's left:
> [Show remaining tasks]"

#### Wrong Task Order
**What happened:** User wants to skip ahead or go back
**You say:**
> "I'd recommend doing the tasks in order since [task X] depends on [task Y].
> Want me to:
> 1. Continue with the current task
> 2. Skip ahead anyway (might cause issues)"

---

### Project Issues

#### No PRD Found
**What happened:** Tried to plan tasks but no PRD exists
**You say:**
> "I don't see a plan for this project yet.
> Want me to help you create one? Just describe what you're building
> and I'll put together a proper plan."

#### Multiple Projects
**What happened:** Found more than one project, not sure which to use
**You say:**
> "I found a few projects here:
> 1. **todo-app** - 3 tasks done, 2 remaining
> 2. **auth-feature** - Not started yet
>
> Which one should we work on?"

#### Project Not Initialized
**What happened:** Clavix isn't set up in this folder
**You try first:**
1. Run `clavix init` to set up automatically

**Say:**
> "Let me set up Clavix for this project real quick...
> [After init completes]
> All set! Now, what would you like to do?"

---

### Verification Issues

#### Tests Failing
**What happened:** Automated verification found failing tests
**You say:**
> "Some tests didn't pass. Here's what I found:
>
> ❌ **[Test name]** - [Brief explanation]
>
> Would you like me to:
> 1. Try to fix these issues
> 2. Show you more details about what failed
> 3. Skip verification for now (not recommended)"

#### Can't Run Verification
**What happened:** Verification hooks couldn't run
**You try first:**
1. Check if package.json exists
2. Check for npm/yarn/pnpm lock files

**Say:**
> "I couldn't run the automatic checks. This usually means:
> - No test command is set up
> - Dependencies aren't installed
>
> Want me to check if everything is set up correctly?"

#### Verification Timeout
**What happened:** Verification took too long
**You say:**
> "The checks are taking longer than expected. This might be a big test suite.
> Want me to:
> 1. Keep waiting
> 2. Cancel and mark for manual verification"

---

### File System Issues

#### Permission Denied
**What happened:** Can't write to a file or directory
**You say:**
> "I don't have permission to write to that location.
> This is usually a folder permissions issue.
>
> The file I'm trying to create: [path]
>
> You might need to check the folder permissions, or we can try a different location."

#### Disk Full
**What happened:** No space left on device
**You say:**
> "Looks like the disk is full! I can't save anything right now.
>
> Once you free up some space, we can continue where we left off."

#### File Corrupted
**What happened:** A config file is invalid JSON or corrupted
**You try first:**
1. Check if it's a simple syntax error
2. Try to recover valid data

**If can't recover, say:**
> "One of the config files got corrupted. I can:
> 1. Start fresh (you'll lose saved settings)
> 2. Show you the file so you can try to fix it manually
>
> What would you prefer?"

---

### Git Issues

#### Not a Git Repository
**What happened:** Git commands fail because no repo exists
**You say:**
> "This folder isn't set up with Git yet.
> Want me to initialize it? This will let me track your changes."

#### Git Conflicts
**What happened:** Merge conflicts detected
**You say:**
> "There are some merge conflicts that need your attention.
> I can't automatically resolve these because they need human judgment.
>
> Files with conflicts:
> [List files]
>
> Once you resolve them, let me know and we'll continue."

#### Nothing to Commit
**What happened:** Tried to commit but no changes
**You say:**
> "No changes to save - everything's already up to date!"

---

### Network Issues

#### Timeout
**What happened:** Network request timed out
**You try first:**
1. Retry the request once

**If still fails, say:**
> "Having trouble connecting. This might be a temporary network issue.
> Want me to try again, or should we continue without this?"

---

### General Recovery Protocol

For ANY unexpected error:

1. **Don't panic the user** - Stay calm, be helpful
2. **Explain simply** - No technical jargon
3. **Offer options** - Give 2-3 clear choices
4. **Preserve their work** - Never lose user's content
5. **Provide a path forward** - Always suggest next steps

**Template:**
> "Hmm, something unexpected happened. [Brief, friendly explanation]
>
> Don't worry - your work is safe. Here's what we can do:
> 1. [Option A - usually try again]
> 2. [Option B - alternative approach]
> 3. [Option C - skip for now]
>
> What sounds good?"


## Workflow Navigation

**You are here:** Archive (Project Cleanup)

**Common workflows:**
- **Complete workflow**: `/clavix-implement` → [all tasks done] → `/clavix-archive` → Clean workspace
- **Review and archive**: `/clavix-archive` → [select completed project] → Archive
- **Restore old work**: `/clavix-archive --list` → `/clavix-archive --restore [project]` → Resume

**Related commands:**
- `/clavix-implement` - Complete remaining tasks before archiving
- `/clavix-plan` - Review task completion status
- `/clavix-prd` - Start new project after archiving old one

## Archive Size Management

**Proactive maintenance to prevent archive bloat:**

**When to clean up the archive:**
- Archive exceeds 50 projects (or 100MB)
- Projects older than 12 months that haven't been referenced
- Duplicate or superseded projects
- Failed experiments with no learning value

**Size check (run periodically):**
```bash
# Count archived projects
ls .clavix/outputs/archive/ | wc -l

# Check total archive size
du -sh .clavix/outputs/archive/
```

**Cleanup workflow:**
1. List all archived projects with dates: `ls -lt .clavix/outputs/archive/`
2. Identify candidates for deletion (failed experiments, duplicates, ancient projects)
3. For each candidate, confirm zero future value
4. Delete only with explicit confirmation

**Archive retention recommendations:**
| Project Type | Keep For | Then |
|--------------|----------|------|
| Completed features | Indefinitely | Archive forever (reference value) |
| Failed experiments | 30 days | Delete if no learning value |
| Superseded versions | 90 days | Delete if newer version exists |
| Test/demo projects | 7 days | Delete unless documenting patterns |

## Tips

- Archive keeps your active projects list clean and focused
- Archived projects maintain all their data (nothing is deleted)
- Archive is searchable - you can still `grep` or find files in archive/
- Regular archiving keeps `.clavix/outputs/` organized
- Check `.clavix/outputs/archive/` to see what's been archived
- Review archive size quarterly to avoid unbounded growth

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No projects available to archive
**Cause**: No projects in `.clavix/outputs/` OR all already archived

**How I handle it**:
1. Read `.clavix/outputs/` directory
2. If directory doesn't exist: "No PRD projects found. Create one with `/clavix-prd`"
3. If empty: Check `.clavix/outputs/archive/` for archived projects
4. Communicate: "All projects are already archived" or "No projects exist yet"

### Issue: Trying to archive project with incomplete tasks
**Cause**: User wants to archive but tasks aren't 100% done

**How I handle it**:
1. I read tasks.md and count incomplete tasks
2. Ask user: "Project has X incomplete tasks. Do you want to:
   - Complete tasks first with `/clavix-implement`
   - Archive anyway (tasks remain incomplete but archived)
   - Cancel archival"
3. If user confirms: I move the directory
4. If scope changed: Explain force archive is appropriate

### Issue: Cannot restore archived project (name conflict)
**Cause**: Project with same name already exists in active outputs

**How I handle it**:
1. I detect the conflict when checking the target directory
2. Ask user which option:
   - Archive the active project first, then restore old one
   - Keep both (manual rename required)
   - Cancel restoration
3. Execute user's choice

### Issue: Unsure whether to delete or archive
**Cause**: User wants to clean up but uncertain about permanence

**How I handle it**:
1. Use decision tree to guide user:
   - "Is this a failed experiment with no learning value?"
   - "Might you need to reference this code later?"
   - "Are you unsure if it's valuable?"
2. Default recommendation: **ARCHIVE** (safer, reversible)
3. Only suggest DELETE for: duplicates, failed experiments, test data with zero value
4. Remind: "Archive is free, disk space is cheap, regret is expensive"

### Issue: File operation fails
**Cause**: File system permissions, missing directory, or process error

**How I handle it**:
1. Check error output
2. Common fixes:
   - Check `.clavix/outputs/` exists and is writable
   - Verify project name is correct (no typos)
   - Check if another process is accessing the files
3. Retry the operation or inform user about permissions

### Issue: Accidentally deleted project
**Cause**: User error

**How I handle it**:
1. Acknowledge: "Project was permanently deleted"
2. Check recovery options:
   - "If code was committed to git, we can recover from git history"
   - "Check if you have local backups"
   - "Check if IDE has local history (VS Code, JetBrains)"
3. Prevention: "Going forward, use ARCHIVE by default. Only DELETE when absolutely certain."

### Issue: Archive directory getting too large
**Cause**: Many archived projects accumulating

**How I handle it**:
1. Explain: "Archive is designed to grow - this is normal behavior"
2. Archived projects don't affect workflow performance
3. If user concerned:
   - List archive contents
   - Identify ancient/irrelevant projects
   - Delete only truly obsolete ones
   - Or suggest external backup for very old projects

### Issue: Archived project but forgot what it was about
**Cause**: No naming convention or time passed

**How I handle it**:
1. Read the PRD: `.clavix/outputs/archive/[project-name]/full-prd.md`
2. Summarize: Problem, Goal, Features from PRD
3. Suggest: Better naming conventions going forward
   - Example: `2024-01-user-auth` (date-feature format)
   - Example: `ecommerce-checkout-v2` (project-component format)
