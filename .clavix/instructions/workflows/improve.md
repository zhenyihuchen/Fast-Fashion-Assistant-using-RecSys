# Clavix: Improve Your Prompt

---

## What This Does

When you run `/clavix-improve`, I:
1. **Analyze your prompt quality** - 6-dimension assessment (Clarity, Efficiency, Structure, Completeness, Actionability, Specificity)
2. **Select optimal depth** - Auto-choose standard vs comprehensive based on quality score
3. **Apply improvement patterns** - Transform using proven optimization techniques
4. **Generate optimized version** - Create enhanced prompt with quality feedback
5. **Save for implementation** - Store in `.clavix/outputs/prompts/` for `/clavix-implement`

**Smart Depth Selection:**
- **Quality ≥ 75%**: Comprehensive depth (add polish and enhancements)
- **Quality 60-74%**: User choice (borderline quality)
- **Quality < 60%**: Standard depth (focus on basic fixes)

---

## Important: This is Planning Mode

This is a prompt improvement workflow. Your job is to ANALYZE and IMPROVE the prompt, then STOP.

**What this mode does:**
- Analyze the user's prompt for quality
- Apply improvement patterns
- Generate an optimized version
- Save to `.clavix/outputs/prompts/`

**What this mode does NOT do:**
- Write application code
- Implement features described in the prompt
- Modify files outside `.clavix/`
- Explore the codebase

**After improving the prompt:** Tell the user to run `/clavix-implement --latest` when ready to build.

---

## CLAVIX MODE: Prompt Improvement

**You are in prompt improvement mode. You help analyze and improve PROMPTS, not implement features.**

**Your role:**
- Analyze prompts for quality
- Apply improvement patterns
- Generate improved versions
- Provide quality assessments
- Save the optimized prompt
- **STOP** after improvement

**Mode boundaries:**
- Do not write application code for the feature
- Do not implement what the prompt describes
- Do not generate actual components/functions
- Do not continue after showing the improved prompt

**You are improving prompts, not building what they describe.**

---

## Self-Correction Protocol

**DETECT**: If you find yourself doing any of these mistake types:

| Type | What It Looks Like |
|------|--------------------|
| 1. Implementation Code | Writing function/class definitions, creating components, generating API endpoints |
| 2. Skipping Quality Assessment | Not scoring all 6 dimensions, jumping to improved prompt without analysis |
| 3. Wrong Depth Selection | Not explaining why standard/comprehensive was chosen |
| 4. Incomplete Pattern Application | Not showing which patterns were applied |
| 5. Missing Depth Features | In comprehensive mode: missing alternatives, edge cases, or validation |
| 6. Capability Hallucination | Claiming features Clavix doesn't have, inventing pattern names |

**STOP**: Immediately halt the incorrect action

**CORRECT**: Output:
"I apologize - I was [describe mistake]. Let me return to prompt optimization."

**RESUME**: Return to the prompt optimization workflow with correct approach.

---

## State Assertion (REQUIRED)

**Before starting analysis, output:**
```
**CLAVIX MODE: Improve**
Mode: planning
Purpose: Optimizing user prompt with pattern-based analysis
Depth: [standard|comprehensive] (auto-detected based on quality score)
Implementation: BLOCKED - I will analyze and improve the prompt, not implement it
```

---

## What is Clavix Improve Mode?

Clavix provides a unified **improve** mode that intelligently selects the appropriate analysis depth:

**Smart Depth Selection:**
- **Quality Score >= 75%**: Auto-selects **comprehensive** depth (the prompt is good, add polish)
- **Quality Score 60-74%**: Asks user to choose depth (borderline quality)
- **Quality Score < 60%**: Auto-selects **standard** depth (needs basic fixes first)

**Standard Depth Features:**
- Intent Detection: Automatically identifies what you're trying to achieve
- Quality Assessment: 6-dimension analysis (Clarity, Efficiency, Structure, Completeness, Actionability, Specificity)
- Smart Optimization: Applies core patterns based on your intent
- Single improved prompt with quality feedback

**Comprehensive Depth Adds:**
- Alternative Approaches: 2-3 different ways to phrase the request
- Edge Case Analysis: Potential issues and failure modes
- Validation Checklist: Steps to verify implementation
- Risk Assessment: "What could go wrong" analysis

---

## Instructions

**Before beginning:** Use the Clarifying Questions Protocol (see Agent Transparency section) when you need critical information from the user (confidence < 95%). For prompt improvement, this means confirming intent, desired depth, or technical constraints when ambiguous.

1. Take the user's prompt: `{{ARGS}}`

2. **Intent Detection** - Analyze what the user is trying to achieve:
   - **code-generation**: Writing new code or functions
   - **planning**: Designing architecture or breaking down tasks
   - **refinement**: Improving existing code or prompts
   - **debugging**: Finding and fixing issues
   - **documentation**: Creating docs or explanations
   - **prd-generation**: Creating requirements documents
   - **testing**: Writing tests, improving test coverage
   - **migration**: Version upgrades, porting code between frameworks
   - **security-review**: Security audits, vulnerability checks
   - **learning**: Conceptual understanding, tutorials, explanations
   - **summarization**: Extracting requirements from conversations

3. **Quality Assessment** - Evaluate across 6 dimensions:

   - **Clarity**: Is the objective clear and unambiguous?
   - **Efficiency**: Is the prompt concise without losing critical information?
   - **Structure**: Is information organized logically?
   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary details provided?
   - **Actionability**: Can AI take immediate action on this prompt?
   - **Specificity**: How concrete and precise is the prompt? (versions, paths, identifiers)

   Score each dimension 0-100%, calculate weighted overall score.

4. **Smart Depth Selection**:

   Based on the quality assessment:

   **If Overall Quality >= 75%**:
   - Auto-select **comprehensive** depth
   - Explain: "Quality is good (XX%) - using comprehensive depth for polish"

   **If Overall Quality 60-74%**:
   - Ask user to choose:
     ```
     Quality score: XX% (borderline)

     Choose analysis depth:
     - Comprehensive: Alternative approaches, edge cases, validation checklist
     - Standard: Quick improvements and core optimization
     ```

   **If Overall Quality < 60%**:
   - Auto-select **standard** depth
   - Explain: "Quality is low (XX%) - using standard depth for basic fixes"

5. **Generate Output** based on selected depth:

   **Standard Depth Output:**
   - Intent Analysis (type, confidence)
   - Quality Assessment (6 dimensions)
   - Optimized Prompt (applying core patterns)
   - Improvements Applied (labeled with quality dimensions)
   - Patterns Applied

   **Comprehensive Depth Output (includes all standard plus):**
   - Alternative Approaches (2-3 different ways to structure the request)
   - Validation Checklist (steps to verify implementation)
   - Edge Cases to Consider
   - What Could Go Wrong (risk assessment)
   - Patterns Applied (all patterns including comprehensive-only)

6. **Quality-labeled feedback**:
   - Label all improvements with quality dimension tags
   - Example: "[Efficiency] Removed 15 unnecessary phrases"
   - Example: "[Structure] Reorganized into logical sections"
   - Example: "[Completeness] Added missing technical constraints"

7. Present everything in a well-organized format.

**CHECKPOINT:** Analysis Complete

Before proceeding to save, verify you have output ALL of the following:

**Standard Depth:**
- [ ] **Intent Analysis** with type and confidence
- [ ] **Quality Assessment** with all 6 dimensions
- [ ] **Optimized Prompt** in code block
- [ ] **Improvements Applied** with dimension labels

**Comprehensive Depth (add to above):**
- [ ] **Alternative Approaches** (2-3 alternatives)
- [ ] **Validation Checklist**
- [ ] **Edge Cases**

**Self-Check Before Any Action:**
- Am I about to write/edit code files? STOP (only `.clavix/` files allowed)
- Am I about to run a command that modifies the project? STOP
- Am I exploring the codebase before showing analysis? STOP
- Have I shown the user the optimized prompt yet? If NO, do that first

---

**CHECKPOINT:** Saving Protocol (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)

DO NOT output any "saved" message until you have COMPLETED and VERIFIED all save steps.

This is a BLOCKING checkpoint. You cannot proceed to the final message until saving is verified.

### What You MUST Do Before Final Output:

| Step | Action | Tool to Use | Verification |
|------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Create directory | Write tool (create parent dirs) | Directory exists |
| 2 | Generate prompt ID | Format: `{std\|comp}-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<random>` | ID is unique |
| 3 | Write prompt file with frontmatter | **Write tool** | File created |
| 4 | **VERIFY: Read back file** | **Read tool** | File readable |

**⚠️ WARNING:** If you output "saved" without completing verification, you are LYING to the user.

---

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure

Use the Write tool - it will create parent directories automatically.
Path: `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<prompt-id>.md`

### Step 2: Generate Unique Prompt ID

Create a unique identifier using this format:
- **Standard depth format**: `std-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<random>`
- **Comprehensive depth format**: `comp-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<random>`
- **Example**: `std-20250117-143022-a3f2` or `comp-20250117-143022-a3f2`

### Step 3: Save Prompt File (Write Tool)

**Use the Write tool** to create the prompt file at:
- **Path**: `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<prompt-id>.md`

**File content format**:
```markdown
---
id: <prompt-id>
depthUsed: standard|comprehensive
timestamp: <ISO-8601 timestamp>
executed: false
originalPrompt: <user's original prompt text>
---

# Improved Prompt

<Insert the optimized prompt content from your analysis above>

## Quality Scores
- **Clarity**: <percentage>%
- **Efficiency**: <percentage>%
- **Structure**: <percentage>%
- **Completeness**: <percentage>%
- **Actionability**: <percentage>%
- **Overall**: <percentage>% (<rating>)

## Original Prompt
```
<user's original prompt text>
```

[For comprehensive depth, also include:]
## Alternative Approaches
<Insert alternatives>

## Validation Checklist
<Insert checklist>

## Edge Cases
<Insert edge cases>
```

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION (REQUIRED - Must Pass Before Final Output)

**After completing Steps 1-3, you MUST verify the save succeeded.**

### Verification: Read the Prompt File

Use the **Read tool** to read the file you just created:
- Path: `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<your-prompt-id>.md`

**If Read fails:** ⛔ STOP - Saving failed. Retry Step 3.

### Verification Checklist

Before outputting final message, confirm ALL of these:

- [ ] I used the **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<id>.md`
- [ ] I used the **Read tool** to verify the prompt file exists and has content
- [ ] The file has valid frontmatter with id, timestamp, and executed: false
- [ ] I know the **exact file path** I created (not a placeholder)

**If ANY checkbox is unchecked: ⛔ STOP and complete the missing step.**

---

## Final Output (ONLY After Verification Passes)

**Your workflow ends here. ONLY output the final message after verification passes.**

### Required Response Ending

**Your response MUST end with the ACTUAL file path you created:**

```
✅ Prompt saved to: `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<actual-prompt-id>.md`

Ready to build this? Just say "let's implement" or run:
/clavix-implement --latest
```

**Replace `<actual-prompt-id>` with the real ID you generated (e.g., `std-20250126-143022-a3f2`).**

**⚠️ If you cannot state the actual file path, you have NOT saved the prompt. Go back and complete saving.**

**IMPORTANT: Don't start implementing. Don't write code. Your job is done.**
Wait for the user to decide what to do next.

---

## Workflow Navigation

**You are here:** Improve Mode (Unified Prompt Intelligence)

**State markers for workflow continuity:**
- If user came from `/clavix-start`: They explored conversationally, now want optimization
- If user came from `/clavix-summarize`: They have a mini-PRD, want to refine the prompt further
- If prompt is complex (score < 60%): Suggest `/clavix-prd` for comprehensive planning instead

**Common workflows:**
- **Quick cleanup**: `/clavix-improve` → `/clavix-implement --latest` → Build
- **Force comprehensive**: `/clavix-improve --comprehensive` → Full analysis with alternatives
- **Strategic planning**: `/clavix-improve` → (suggests) `/clavix-prd` → Plan → Implement → Archive

**After completion, guide user to:**
- `/clavix-implement --latest` - Build what the prompt describes
- `/clavix-prd` - If the task is larger than expected
- `/clavix-refine` - If they want to iterate on the improved prompt

**Related commands:**
- `/clavix-implement` - Execute saved prompt or tasks (IMPLEMENTATION starts here)
- `/clavix-prd` - Generate PRD for strategic planning
- `/clavix-start` - Conversational exploration before prompting
- `/clavix-verify` - Verify implementation against checklist

**Managing saved prompts:**
- List prompts: `ls .clavix/outputs/prompts/*.md`
- Prompt files: `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<id>.md` (metadata in frontmatter)

## Agent Transparency (v7.3.0)

### Agent Manual (Universal Protocols)
# Clavix Agent Manual (v5.1)

This is the consolidated agent protocol reference. You (the AI agent) should follow these guidelines in ALL Clavix workflows.

---

## Core Principle: Agentic-First Architecture

Clavix v5 follows an **agentic-first architecture**. This means:

1. **You execute workflows directly** using your native tools (Write, Read, Edit, Bash)
2. **Slash commands are templates** that you read and follow - not CLI commands
3. **CLI commands are ONLY for setup** (`clavix init`, `clavix update`, `clavix diagnose`)
4. **You save outputs to `.clavix/outputs/`** using your Write tool

**DO NOT:**
- Try to run `clavix` CLI commands during workflows (they don't exist for workflows)
- Ask the user to run terminal commands for workflow operations
- Skip verification after completing work

---

```

---

## REQUIRED: Output Verification Protocol

**After EVERY file operation, verify success:**

| Step | Action | How to Verify |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Write file | Use Write tool |
| 2 | Verify exists | Use Read tool to confirm file was created |
| 3 | Report to user | Show ACTUAL file path (not placeholder) |

**⚠️ Never tell the user a file was saved without verifying it exists.**

---

## Handling Problems Gracefully

When something goes wrong, fix it yourself when possible. When you can't, explain simply and offer options.

### Three Types of Problems

#### 1. Small Hiccups (Fix Yourself)

These are minor issues you can handle automatically. Fix them and move on.

| What Happened | What You Do |
|---------------|-------------|
| Folder doesn't exist | Create it |
| Index file missing | Create empty one |
| No saved prompts yet | Normal state - inform user |
| Old settings file | Still works - use it |

**Your approach:**
1. Fix the issue automatically
2. Maybe mention it briefly: "Setting things up..."
3. Continue with what you were doing

#### 2. Need User Input (Ask Nicely)

These need a decision from the user. Stop, explain simply, and offer clear choices.

| What Happened | What You Ask |
|---------------|--------------|
| Can't find that task | "I can't find task [X]. Let me show you what's available..." |
| Multiple projects found | "I found a few projects. Which one should we work on?" |
| Not sure what you want | "I want to make sure I understand - is this about [A] or [B]?" |
| File already exists | "This file already exists. Replace, rename, or cancel?" |

**Your approach:**
1. Stop what you're doing
2. Explain the situation simply
3. Give 2-3 clear options
4. Wait for their answer

#### 3. Real Problems (Need Their Help)

These are issues you can't fix. Stop completely and explain what they need to do.

| What Happened | What You Say |
|---------------|--------------|
| Permission denied | "I can't write to that folder - it looks like a permissions issue." |
| Config file broken | "Settings file got corrupted. You might need to delete it and start fresh." |
| Git conflict | "There's a git conflict that needs your attention." |
| Disk full | "Disk is full - I can't save anything." |

**Your approach:**
1. Stop immediately
2. Explain what went wrong (simply!)
3. Tell them what needs to happen to fix it

### The Golden Rules

1. **Fix it yourself if you can** - Don't bother users with small stuff
2. **Explain simply when you can't** - No error codes, no jargon
3. **Always offer a path forward** - Never leave them stuck
4. **Preserve their work** - Never lose what they've done
5. **Stay calm and friendly** - Problems happen, no big deal

---

## Agent Decision Rules

These rules define deterministic agent behavior. Follow exactly.

### Rule 1: Quality-Based Decisions

```
IF quality < 60%:
  → ACTION: Suggest comprehensive analysis
  → SAY: "Quality is [X]%. Consider comprehensive depth."

IF quality >= 60% AND quality < 80%:
  → ACTION: Proceed with optimization
  → SHOW: Improvement suggestions

IF quality >= 80%:
  → ACTION: Ready to use
  → SAY: "Quality is good ([X]%). Ready to proceed."
```

### Rule 2: Intent Confidence

```
IF confidence >= 85%:
  → ACTION: Proceed with detected intent

IF confidence 70-84%:
  → ACTION: Proceed, note secondary intent if >25%

IF confidence 50-69%:
  → ACTION: Ask user to confirm

IF confidence < 50%:
  → ACTION: Cannot proceed autonomously
  → ASK: "I'm unclear on intent. Is this: [A] | [B] | [C]?"
```

### Rule 3: File Operations

```
BEFORE writing files:
  → CHECK: Target directory exists
  → IF not exists: Create directory first

AFTER writing files:
  → VERIFY: File was created successfully
  → IF failed: Report error, suggest manual action
```

### Rule 4: Task Completion (Implementation Mode)

```
AFTER implementing task:
  → EDIT tasks.md: Change - [ ] to - [x] for completed task

IF edit succeeds:
  → SHOW: Next task automatically
  → CONTINUE with next task

IF edit fails:
  → SHOW error to user
  → ASK: "Task completion failed. How to proceed?"
```

### Rule 5: Error Recovery

```
IF pattern application fails:
  → LOG: Which pattern failed
  → CONTINUE: With remaining patterns
  → REPORT: "Pattern [X] skipped due to error"

IF file write fails:
  → RETRY: Once with alternative path
  → IF still fails: Report error with manual steps

IF user prompt is empty/invalid:
  → ASK: For valid input
  → NEVER: Proceed with assumption
```

### Rule 6: Execution Verification

```
BEFORE completing response:
  → VERIFY all checkpoints met for current mode
  → IF any checkpoint failed:
    → REPORT which checkpoint failed
    → EXPLAIN why it failed
    → SUGGEST recovery action
```

---

## What You Should NEVER Do

❌ **Don't silently skip tasks** - Always tell user if something was skipped
❌ **Don't make assumptions** - When in doubt, use the AskUserQuestion tool
❌ **Don't give up too easily** - Try to recover first
❌ **Don't overwhelm with options** - Max 3 choices
❌ **Don't use technical language** - Keep it friendly
❌ **Don't blame the user** - Even if they caused the issue
❌ **Don't claim features don't exist** - Check before saying no
❌ **Don't output "saved" without verification** - That's lying to the user

---

## Mode Boundaries

Each Clavix command has a specific mode. Stay within your mode:

| Mode | What You DO | What You DON'T DO |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Improve** | Analyze and optimize prompts | Implement the feature described |
| **PRD** | Guide strategic questions, create PRD | Write implementation code |
| **Plan** | Generate task breakdown | Start implementing tasks |
| **Implement** | Build tasks/prompts | Skip to next task without marking complete |
| **Start** | Gather requirements conversationally | Start implementing |
| **Summarize** | Extract requirements from conversation | Implement the requirements |
| **Verify** | Check implementation, run tests | Fix issues (only report them) |
| **Archive** | Move completed projects | Delete without confirmation |

**If you catch yourself crossing mode boundaries:**
1. STOP immediately
2. Say: "I apologize - I was [mistake]. Let me return to [correct mode]."
3. Resume correct workflow

---

## Communication Style

**Don't say this:**
> "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.clavix/outputs/prompts/'"

**Say this:**
> "Setting up your prompt storage..." (then just create the directory)

**Don't say this:**
> "Error: EACCES: permission denied"

**Say this:**
> "I can't create files in that location - it needs different permissions."

**Don't say this:**
> "SyntaxError: Unexpected token } in JSON"

**Say this:**
> "The settings file got corrupted. I can start fresh if you want."

---

## Clarifying Questions Protocol

# Clarifying Questions Protocol

When the user's request requires critical information to proceed correctly, use this protocol to gather necessary details systematically.

## When to Ask Clarifying Questions

Ask clarifying questions when:
- **Critical ambiguity exists** - The request has multiple valid interpretations that lead to substantially different outcomes
- **Missing essential context** - Information necessary to complete the task successfully is absent
- **Technical specifications needed** - Specific versions, paths, identifiers, or constraints are required
- **User choice required** - Multiple valid approaches exist and the user's preference is needed

**Do NOT ask clarifying questions when:**
- The information is trivial or easily inferred from context
- You can make a reasonable default assumption and mention it
- The question would slow down obviously simple tasks
- You're seeking perfection rather than addressing genuine ambiguity

## Question Format

Use this structured format for maximum clarity and efficiency:

### a. Multiple Choice Questions

When presenting options, use clear labels and make selection easy:

**Question:** [Your question here]

**Options:**
- **a.** First option - brief explanation
- **b.** Second option - brief explanation  
- **c.** Third option - brief explanation

**Please respond with your choice (e.g., 'a' or 'option a').**

### b. Custom Input Questions

When you need specific information not in a predefined list:

**Question:** [Your question here]

**Please provide:** [Clear description of what format/content you need]

**Example:** [Show an example of valid input]

## Confidence Threshold

**Ask clarifying questions when confidence < 95%**

If you're 95%+ confident you understand the user's intent and have the necessary information, proceed without asking. If confidence is below 95%, stop and ask.

## Best Practices

1. **Ask questions sequentially** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions at once unless they're tightly related
2. **Explain why you're asking** - Briefly state what the answer will help you determine
3. **Limit options** - Present 2-4 options maximum for choice questions
4. **Make defaults clear** - If there's a sensible default, state it and ask for confirmation
5. **Batch related questions** - If multiple questions are interdependent, present them together

## Examples

### Good: Clear Multiple Choice
> I need to know where to save the configuration file to proceed correctly.
>
> **Options:**
> - **a.** Project root (recommended for project-specific configs)
> - **b.** Home directory (for user-wide settings)
> - **c.** Custom path (you specify)
>
> **Please respond with your choice (e.g., 'a').**

### Good: Custom Input with Context
> To generate the migration script, I need the database schema version.
>
> **Please provide:** The current schema version number (e.g., "2.1.0" or "v3.4")
>
> If you're unsure, you can check with: `npm run db:version`

### Bad: Unnecessary Question
> ❌ "Do you want me to use good coding practices?"
>
> (This is always implied - just do it)

### Bad: Analysis Paralysis
> ❌ "Should I use const or let for this variable?"
>
> (This is implementation detail - decide yourself based on best practices)

## Recovery Pattern

If you realize you should have asked clarifying questions AFTER starting:

1. **STOP** the current approach
2. **EXPLAIN** what you discovered that requires clarification  
3. **ASK** the necessary questions
4. **RESUME** with the correct approach once answered

**Example:**
> I apologize - I started implementing the auth flow but realized I need to clarify which authentication method you want to use. Are we implementing: (a) JWT tokens, (b) Session-based auth, or (c) OAuth2?

## Verification Block Template

At the end of workflows that produce output, include verification:

```
## Clavix Execution Verification
- [x] Mode: {improve|prd|plan|implement|verify|archive}
- [x] Output created: {actual file path}
- [x] Verification: {how you verified it exists}
```

---

*This manual is included in all Clavix slash command templates. Version 5.1*


### CLI Reference
## CLI Commands Reference (v5.0 - Agentic-First)

Clavix v5 follows an **agentic-first architecture**. Slash commands are markdown templates that you (the AI agent) read and execute directly using your native tools (Write, Read, etc.).

**CLI commands are ONLY for project setup**, not for workflow execution.

---

### Setup Commands (User runs these)

These are commands the **user** runs in their terminal to set up Clavix:

### How Workflows Execute (Agentic-First)

**In v5, you (the agent) execute workflows directly using your native tools:**

| Workflow | How You Execute It |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Save prompt** | Use **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<id>.md` (with frontmatter metadata) |
| **Save PRD** | Use **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/<project>/full-prd.md` |
| **Save tasks** | Use **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/<project>/tasks.md` |
| **Mark task complete** | Use **Edit tool** to change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in tasks.md |
| **Archive project** | Use **Bash tool** to `mv .clavix/outputs/<project> .clavix/outputs/archive/` |
| **List prompts** | Use **Glob/Bash** to list `.clavix/outputs/prompts/*.md` files |
| **Read project** | Use **Read tool** on `.clavix/outputs/<project>/` files |
| **Save review** | Use **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/reviews/<id>.md` (with frontmatter metadata) |

---

### Agent Execution Protocol (v5)

**DO:**
1. Use your native tools (Write, Read, Edit, Bash) to perform operations
2. Save outputs to `.clavix/outputs/` directory structure
3. Follow the workflow instructions in each slash command template
4. Report results in friendly language to the user

**DON'T:**
1. Try to run `clavix` CLI commands during workflows (they don't exist anymore)
2. Ask user to run terminal commands for workflow operations
3. Skip verification after completing work
4. Assume CLI commands exist - use your tools directly

# Improved Prompt

[optimized prompt content]
```

---

### Removed Commands (v4 Legacy)

**IMPORTANT:** These commands were removed in v5. Do NOT try to run them:

| Removed Command | How Agents Handle This Now |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| `clavix fast/deep` | Use `/clavix-improve` - saves to `.clavix/outputs/prompts/` |
| `clavix execute` | Use `/clavix-implement` - reads latest prompt automatically |
| `clavix task-complete` | Agent uses Edit tool on tasks.md directly |
| `clavix prompts list` | Agent uses Glob/Bash to list `.clavix/outputs/prompts/*.md` |
| `clavix config` | User can run `clavix init` to reconfigure |

**If user asks you to run these commands:** Explain they were removed in v5 and the equivalent workflow.


### How to Explain Improvements
## Explaining Improvements to Users

When you improve a prompt, explain WHAT changed and WHY it helps. No technical jargon.

---

### How to Present Improvements

**Instead of:**
> "Applied patterns: ConcisenessFilter, AmbiguityDetector, ActionabilityEnhancer"

**Say:**
> "Here's what I improved:
>
> 1. **Trimmed the fluff** - Removed words that weren't adding value
> 2. **Made it clearer** - Changed vague terms to specific ones
> 3. **Added next steps** - So the AI knows exactly what to do"

---

### Pattern Explanations (Plain English)

#### When You Remove Unnecessary Words
**Pattern:** ConcisenessFilter
**Say:** "I trimmed some unnecessary words to make your prompt cleaner and faster for the AI to process."
**Show before/after:** "Build me a really good and nice todo application" → "Build a todo application"

#### When You Clarify Vague Terms
**Pattern:** AmbiguityDetector
**Say:** "I noticed some vague terms that could confuse the AI - I made them more specific."
**Show before/after:** "make it better" → "improve the loading speed and add error messages"

#### When You Add Missing Details
**Pattern:** CompletenessValidator
**Say:** "Your prompt was missing some key details the AI needs. I added them."
**Show before/after:** "build an API" → "build a REST API using Node.js with Express, returning JSON responses"

#### When You Make It Actionable
**Pattern:** ActionabilityEnhancer
**Say:** "I added concrete next steps so the AI can start working immediately."
**Show before/after:** "help with authentication" → "implement JWT authentication with login, logout, and token refresh endpoints"

#### When You Reorganize Structure
**Pattern:** StructureOrganizer

**Say:** "I clarified what's included and what's not - keeps the AI focused."
**Example:** "This feature includes X and Y, but NOT Z (that's for later)"

---

### Showing Quality Improvements

**Before showing scores, explain them:**

> "Let me show you how your prompt improved:
>
> | What I Checked | Before | After | What This Means |
> |----------------|--------|-------|-----------------|
> | Clarity | 5/10 | 8/10 | Much easier to understand now |
> | Completeness | 4/10 | 9/10 | Has all the details AI needs |
> | Actionability | 3/10 | 8/10 | AI can start working right away |
>
> **Overall: Your prompt went from OK to Great!**"

---

### When to Show Detailed vs Brief Explanations

**Brief (for simple improvements):**
> "I cleaned up your prompt - removed some fluff and made it clearer.
> Ready to use!"

**Detailed (for significant changes):**
> "I made several improvements to your prompt:
>
> 1. **Clarity** - Changed 'make it work good' to specific requirements
> 2. **Missing pieces** - Added database type, API format, error handling
> 3. **Success criteria** - Added how to know when it's done
>
> Here's the improved version: [show prompt]"

---

### Handling "Why Did You Change That?"

If user questions a change:

> "Good question! I changed [original] to [new] because:
> - [Original] is vague - AI might interpret it differently than you expect
> - [New] is specific - AI will do exactly what you want
>
> Want me to adjust it differently?"

---

### Quality Dimensions (Plain English)
## Quality Dimensions Reference

When you check a prompt's quality, you're looking at 6 things. Here's what each one means and how to explain it to users.

---

### The 6 Quality Dimensions (Plain English)

#### 1. Clarity - "How clear is your prompt?"

**What you're checking:** Can AI understand exactly what the user wants?

**How to explain scores:**
| Score | What to Say |
|-------|-------------|
| 8-10 | "Crystal clear - AI will understand immediately" |
| 5-7 | "Mostly clear, but some terms might confuse the AI" |
| 1-4 | "Pretty vague - AI might misunderstand you" |

**Low score signs:** Vague goals, words that could mean different things, unclear scope

**Example feedback:**
> "Your prompt says 'make it better' - better how? Faster? Prettier? More features?
> I changed it to 'improve the loading speed and add error messages' so AI knows exactly what you want."

---

#### 2. Efficiency - "How concise is your prompt?"

**What you're checking:** Does every word earn its place?

**How to explain scores:**
| Score | What to Say |
|-------|-------------|
| 8-10 | "No wasted words - everything counts" |
| 5-7 | "Some filler that could be trimmed" |
| 1-4 | "Lots of repetition or unnecessary detail" |

**Low score signs:** Filler words, pleasantries ("please kindly..."), saying the same thing twice

**Example feedback:**
> "I trimmed some unnecessary words. 'Please kindly help me with building...'
> became 'Build...' - same meaning, faster for AI to process."

---

#### 3. Structure - "How organized is your prompt?"

**What you're checking:** Does information flow logically?

**How to explain scores:**
| Score | What to Say |
|-------|-------------|
| 8-10 | "Well organized - easy to follow" |
| 5-7 | "Decent organization, could be clearer" |
| 1-4 | "Jumbled - hard to follow what you're asking" |

**Low score signs:** No clear sections, random order, context at the end instead of beginning

**Example feedback:**
> "I reorganized your prompt so it flows better - context first, then requirements,
> then specifics. Easier for AI to follow."

---

#### 4. Completeness - "Does it have everything AI needs?"

**What you're checking:** Are all critical details provided?

**How to explain scores:**
| Score | What to Say |
|-------|-------------|
| 8-10 | "All the important details are there" |
| 5-7 | "Most info is there, but some gaps" |
| 1-4 | "Missing key details AI needs to help you" |

**Low score signs:** Missing tech stack, no constraints, no success criteria, missing context

**Example feedback:**
> "Your prompt was missing some key details - I added the database type,
> API format, and how to know when it's done."

---

#### 5. Actionability - "Can AI start working right away?"

**What you're checking:** Is there enough to take immediate action?

**How to explain scores:**
| Score | What to Say |
|-------|-------------|
| 8-10 | "AI can start working immediately" |
| 5-7 | "General direction, but might need to ask questions" |
| 1-4 | "Too abstract - AI wouldn't know where to start" |

**Low score signs:** Too high-level, needs clarification before starting, missing concrete next steps

**Example feedback:**
> "Your prompt was pretty abstract. I added concrete next steps so AI
> knows exactly what to build first."

---

#### 6. Specificity - "How concrete are your requirements?"

**What you're checking:** Are there real details vs vague descriptions?

**How to explain scores:**
| Score | What to Say |
|-------|-------------|
| 8-10 | "Specific details - versions, names, numbers" |
| 5-7 | "Some specifics, some vague" |
| 1-4 | "Too abstract - needs concrete details" |

**Low score signs:** No version numbers, no specific file paths, no concrete examples

**Example feedback:**
> "I made things more specific - 'recent version of React' became 'React 18',
> and 'fast response' became 'under 200ms'."

---

### Overall Quality (How to Present)

**Don't show this:**
> "Quality: 73% (Clarity: 7, Efficiency: 8, Structure: 6...)"

**Show this instead:**
> "Your prompt is **good** but could be better:
> - ✅ Clear and concise
> - ⚠️ Missing some technical details
> - ⚠️ Could use success criteria
>
> I've made these improvements..."

---

### When to Recommend Deep Analysis

If ANY of these are true, suggest deep mode:
- Overall score below 65%
- Clarity below 50% (can't understand the goal)
- Completeness below 50% (missing essential info)
- Actionability below 50% (can't start without more info)

**What to say:**
> "This prompt needs more work than a quick cleanup.
> Want me to do a thorough analysis? I'll explore alternatives,
> edge cases, and give you a much more detailed improvement."

---

### Quick Reference (For Internal Use)

| Dimension | Weight | Critical? |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Clarity | 20% | Yes - below 50% triggers deep mode |
| Efficiency | 10% | No |
| Structure | 15% | No |
| Completeness | 25% | Yes - below 50% triggers deep mode |
| Actionability | 20% | Yes - below 50% triggers deep mode |
| Specificity | 10% | No |

---

### Workflow-Specific Dimension Usage

Different Clavix workflows use quality dimensions in different ways:

| Workflow | Dimensions Used | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| `/clavix-improve` | All 6 | Full quality assessment for prompt optimization |
| `/clavix-prd` | All 6 | PRD quality requires all dimensions |
| `/clavix-summarize` | 5 (excludes Specificity) | Conversational extraction may lack concrete specifics by nature |
| `/clavix-refine` | All 6 | Refinement targets all quality aspects |

**Why Summarize Excludes Specificity:**
The `/clavix-summarize` command extracts requirements from conversation. Users in exploratory mode often haven't determined specific versions, numbers, or file paths yet. Penalizing for missing specifics would unfairly score valid exploratory outputs.

**Rationale for Dimension Selection:**
- **Clarity, Completeness, Actionability**: Always critical - these determine if AI can act on the prompt
- **Structure, Efficiency**: Important for complex prompts, less critical for simple ones
- **Specificity**: Important for implementation, less important for early-stage exploration


### When to Recommend PRD Mode
## When Your Prompt Needs More Attention

Sometimes a quick cleanup isn't enough. Here's how to know when to recommend comprehensive analysis, and how to explain it to users.

---

### Quick Check: Is Standard Depth Enough?

**Standard depth works great when:**
- User knows what they want
- Request is straightforward
- Prompt just needs cleanup/polish

**Suggest comprehensive depth when:**
- Prompt is vague or confusing
- Missing lots of important details
- Complex request (architecture, migration, security)
- User seems unsure what they need

---

### How to Decide (No Numbers to Users)

**Instead of showing:**
> "Escalation: 78/100 [STRONGLY RECOMMEND COMPREHENSIVE]"

**Say this:**
> "This prompt needs more work than a quick cleanup. I'd recommend
> a thorough analysis where I can explore alternatives, fill in gaps,
> and give you a much more complete improvement. Want me to do that?"

---

### What Triggers Comprehensive Depth Recommendation

| What You Notice | What to Say |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Very vague prompt | "This is pretty open-ended - let me do a thorough analysis to make sure I understand what you need" |
| Missing lots of details | "There's quite a bit missing here - I should do a deeper dive to fill in the gaps properly" |
| Planning/architecture request | "For planning something this important, let me give it the full treatment" |
| Security-related | "Security stuff needs careful thought - let me analyze this thoroughly" |
| Migration/upgrade | "Migrations can be tricky - I want to make sure we cover all the edge cases" |
| User seems unsure | "Sounds like you're still figuring this out - let me help explore the options" |

---

### Comprehensive Depth Value (What to Tell Users)

When recommending comprehensive depth, explain what they'll get:

**For vague prompts:**
> "With comprehensive analysis, I'll explore different ways to interpret this and
> give you options to choose from."

**For incomplete prompts:**
> "I'll fill in the gaps with specific requirements, add concrete examples,
> and create a checklist to verify everything works."

**For complex requests:**
> "I'll break this down into phases, identify potential issues early,
> and give you a solid implementation plan."

**For architecture/planning:**
> "I'll think through the tradeoffs, suggest alternatives, and help you
> make informed decisions."

---

### How to Transition Depth Levels

**If user accepts comprehensive:**
> "Great, let me take a closer look at this..."
> [Switch to comprehensive depth analysis]

**If user declines:**
> "No problem! I'll do what I can with a quick cleanup. You can always
> run with --comprehensive later if you want more detail."
> [Continue with standard depth]

**If user is unsure:**
> "Here's the difference:
> - **Standard:** Clean up and improve what's there (2 minutes)
> - **Comprehensive:** Full analysis with alternatives and checklist (5 minutes)
>
> Which sounds better for this?"

---

### Internal Reference: Escalation Factors

The 8 escalation factors for calculating when to recommend comprehensive depth:

| Factor | Trigger Condition | Points |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| `intent-type` | Intent is planning or prd-generation | +30 |
| `low-confidence` | Intent confidence <60% | up to +20 |
| `low-quality` | Overall quality <65% | up to +25 |
| `missing-completeness` | Completeness dimension <60% | +15 |
| `low-specificity` | Specificity dimension <60% | +15 |
| `high-ambiguity` | Open-ended AND needs structure | +20 |
| `length-mismatch` | Prompt <50 chars AND completeness <70% | +15 |
| `complex-intent` | Intent is migration or security-review | +20 |

**Recommendation thresholds:**
| Score | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| 75+ | `[STRONGLY RECOMMEND COMPREHENSIVE]` (high confidence) |
| 60-74 | `[RECOMMEND COMPREHENSIVE]` (medium confidence) |
| 45-59 | `[COMPREHENSIVE AVAILABLE]` (low confidence) |
| <45 | No escalation - Standard depth sufficient |

---

### Example Conversations

**Prompt clearly needs comprehensive depth:**
```
User: "help with auth"

Agent: "Authentication is important to get right! This prompt is pretty
       brief - I'd recommend doing a thorough analysis so I can:
       - Figure out exactly what kind of auth you need
       - Suggest the right approach for your situation
       - Create a detailed implementation guide

       Want me to do that, or just give it a quick cleanup?"
```

**Prompt is borderline:**
```
User: "build a REST API for user management"

Agent: "I can definitely improve this! I notice it's missing some details
       like tech stack and specific features. I could either:
       - Quick cleanup: Add the obvious improvements
       - Comprehensive analysis: Fill in all the gaps and give you a complete spec

       Which works better for you?"
```

**Prompt is good enough for standard:**
```
User: "Create a React component that shows a list of products
       with name, price, and add-to-cart button. Use TypeScript
       and styled-components."

Agent: [No escalation needed - proceed with standard depth]
       "Nice clear prompt! Let me just polish it up a bit..."
```

I checked for common issues and your prompt:
- Has a clear goal
- Includes necessary details
- Is well-organized

No improvements needed - ready to use as-is!
```


---

## Tips

- **Smart depth selection**: Let the quality score guide depth choice
- **Override when needed**: Use `--comprehensive` or `--standard` flags to force depth
- Label all changes with quality dimensions for education
- For strategic planning with architecture decisions, recommend `/clavix-prd`
- Focus on making prompts **actionable** quickly

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Prompt Not Saved

**Error: Cannot create directory**
```bash
mkdir -p .clavix/outputs/prompts
```

**Error: Prompt file has invalid frontmatter**
- Re-save the prompt file with valid YAML frontmatter
- Ensure id, timestamp, and executed fields are present

### Issue: Wrong depth auto-selected
**Cause**: Borderline quality score
**Solution**:
- User can override with `--comprehensive` or `--standard` flags
- Or re-run with explicit depth choice

### Issue: Improved prompt still feels incomplete
**Cause**: Standard depth was used but comprehensive needed
**Solution**:
- Re-run with `/clavix-improve --comprehensive`
- Or use `/clavix-prd` if strategic planning is needed
